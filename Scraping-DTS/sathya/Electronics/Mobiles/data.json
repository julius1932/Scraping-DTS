    "description": "Elevating Front Camera\nTo create the ultimate viewing experience, NEX’s front camera is hidden behind the display. When taking selfies, it elevates in just 1 second, then retracts automatically when you’re done.Thanks to a new micro drive system – which includes a highly sophisticated micro stepping motor, an independent driver IC and a precision control algorithm - the camera moves like magic; blending seamless aesthetics with clockwork precision.In-Display Fingerprint Scanning\nNEX’s In-Display Fingerprint Scanning is what makes the Ultra FullView™ Display experience possible. The fingerprint sensor is hidden underneath the display, giving NEX its sleek, futuristic look.Dedicated AI Button for Jovi\nNEX features a leftside AI button for Jovi strictly dedicated to a full range of AI services.Just press and hold this button and Google Assistant is at your service. This is a convenient feature when you don’t want to be seen talking to your phone in public. And it is especially helpful when voice recognition is hindered (as in a noisy restaurant).NEX also comes loaded with Google lens. Just point the camera and push the AI button. It will then look up the object online and display related search results and information.8GB RAM + Qualcomm Snapdragon 845\nWhen it comes to performance, never settle for second best. With a whopping 8GB of RAM and a top of the line Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, NEX never hesitates even when performing complex tasks. And it runs 30%* more powerful than the previous generation.At the heart of this premium platform is a 64-bit CPU - Qualcomm Kryo 385 with an advanced 10 nanometer design and a clock speed of up to 2.8 GHz. NEX further features an Adreno 630 Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) which is 30%* more powerful than its predecessor, as well as more energy efficient.Dual-Pixel Sensors\nThe specifications on the NEX camera are simply jaw dropping. A new generation Sony IMX363 lens (6P with sapphire crystal surface), 12MP Dual-Pixel focusing, 1.4μm super large pixel sensors, f/1.8 large aperture, 4-axis optical image stabilization (OIS) and the industry leading super powerful Adreno 630 GPU. Regardless of your surroundings – no matter how dark, or fleeting the moment – outstanding photos await.Longer Lasting Battery Life\nLeave the inconvenience of frequent charging behind. With a 4,000 mAh battery, NEX runs longer than ever - even through intensive use and extensive play.Professional Hi-Fi Quality Sound\nVivo breaks new ground in Hi-Fi with System in Package technology (SIP). A single chip encloses both a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) and a matrix with three operational amplifiers. And while the circuit board is over 50% smaller than the Vivo Xplay 6 - the audio performance has never been so outstanding, with a dynamic range reaching up to 130 dB and distortion minimized to -115 dB. Immerse yourself in an amazing professional Hi-Fi audio.File Manager\nKeep all files from one app together. File filtering is also supported, so you can neatly organize and edit valuable files, audio recordings, videos and pictures, compressed folders and install package while invalid files stay hidden.",

When night falls, let the R17 Pro unveil the beauty around you.Encased in fog, Awash in flowing lightElegance meets enchantment in the R17 Pro’s Radiant Mist casing with fog lighting that flows between deep blue and purple hues. Its 3D misted glass and inner light condensation blend and shift with changes of light and shadow around you, giving you a dreamy, immersive aesthetic that moves with you.Waterdrop Screen, Life in watercolorWater is life. The unique shape of the R17 Pro’s notch is inspired by a droplet of water captured at the moment before it falls; a brief, transitional state between movement and stillness, where anything is possible.
