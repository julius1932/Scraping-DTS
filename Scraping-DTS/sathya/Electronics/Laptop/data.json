    "description": "An IT manager’s dream\nThe ThinkPad T480 has a match-on-chip fingerprint reader, anti-spoofing technology that authenticates log-in credentials and helps safeguards your data, and ThinkShutter, a webcam cover that you can open and close. It also has an integrated global LTE-A feature that keeps you connected around the world, WiFi or not.Furthermore, to help save time setting up and deploying each T480, there's Microsoft AutoPilot. This cloud-based solution lets you preconfigure every laptop so that they are ready to use right out of the box. Raises performance levels and eyebrows\nDelivering higher performance and far faster than its predecessor, the new 8th generation Intel® Core™ i7 processor is designed to take your productivity to new heights. Backed by the increased efficiency and speed of DDR4 memory (up to 32 GB), the T480 gives you the power of a desktop PC and the freedom of a portable laptop.Where form meets function\nInspired by our ThinkPad customers, this latest T-Series business machine has a USB-C docking connector on the side rather than underneath, enabling the T480 to be just 19.95 mm / 0.79 inch thin. It also has a range of convenient ports, including the lightning-quick Intel® Thunderbolt™ 3. In addition, should you need to work on the go or in low-light conditions, the renowned ThinkPad ergonomic keyboard has a convenient backlight.Power up without powering down\nThe T480 comes with built-in Power Bridge technology as standard. This innovation is the answer to 'low battery' warnings, especially if you are on the road or without a nearby power outlet. It allows you to swap out a battery and replace it with a fully charged one—without having to turn your machine off. You can also choose a T480 with a 72 Whr battery, which will run for up to 30.3 hours between charges.Get closer to the action\nBy configuring your T480 with an optional touchscreen, you can interact more intuitively and easily with your work—and have more fun during your downtime.Practical yet secure\nThanks to Windows Hello, a touch fingerprint reader, and optional IR (infrared) camera, you can save time by logging in with just your finger or a smile. Alternatively, the standard webcam comes with ThinkShutter, a physical cover that you can slide open when you want to use the camera and then close it when you're finished.Tested for battle, built for success\nEvery ThinkPad laptop undergoes stringent testing for reliability and durability, including the ability to survive in hazardous physical and environmental conditions.Stronger online security, made easy\nSigning into websites or making online payments usually involves trying to remember all kinds of passwords. Not so with the FIDO—Fast Identity Online—authentication capabilities that are built into the latest generation of ThinkPad laptops. By wrapping your user info and credentials into three secure layers, FIDO makes it safer and easier when you are online. This global solution also creates better security of web-based services and reduces cost for organizations. A win-win for everyone.One less thing to worry about\nFor extra peace of mind, each T480 comes with a worldwide warranty as standard. This enables you to seek expert assistance and help in 160 countries across the globe.",

On the other, its maximum brightness of only 236.1 nits is too dim. Taking the notebook’s price into consideration, a brightness of more than 300 nits would have been appropriate. At least we found no evidence of PWM-flickering whatsoever.There were no surprises in terms of connectivity. The notebook features 3 USB Type-A ports (2x USB 2.0, 1x USB 3.1 Gen. 1), a single USB Type-C port (USB 3.1 Gen. 1), and HDMI-video output. The ports are positioned towards the rear on both sides thus leaving the front next to the palm rests free of clutter.The 3168 Wi-Fi chip is made by Intel, and it supports the whole nine yards of Wi-Fi standards: 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac. Tested under ideal conditions (no other Wi-Fi devices nearby, short distance between notebook and server) it performed very well. A full-sized and fast Ethernet port powered by a Realtek RTL8168/8111 chip is available as well.",

And it’s been fully redesigned for mobility, meaning IT won’t have to listen to complaints about a heavy laptop. That mobility is enhanced by its RapidCharge function, allowing users to get up to an 80% charge in just an hour. The L380 will make your employees’ jobs easier, a favor they will return to your IT department. Additional details on these features are available below.The L380 will take on your full workload, thanks to the latest Intel® Core™ processors (with optional Intel® vPro™ technology for advanced security and manageability). Its 2x2 AC WiFi and full array of ports will keep you connected to the internet and a variety of external devices. And inputting commands is a breeze with the optional multitouch display. Get ready to have a much shorter to-do list.The L380 was built for the road warrior, and will go anywhere with ease. Its optional backlit keyboard – with white LEDs – lets you use it in low-light surroundings and complete even the most urgent of tasks despite the late hours, and its optional IPS FHD display is easy on tired, traveling eyes. With up to 12 hours of life in its battery, you’ll get a lot of uninterrupted time without worrying about electrical outlets – and even if you need to plug in, its RapidCharge feature will give you 80% battery capacity in an hour.Whether you need to get online or use a peripheral device, the L380 can connect you. Extensive I/O ports such as USB Type-C, USB 3.0, and HDMI make it easy to plug in most peripheral devices, while Near Field Communication (NFC) technology gives you the luxury of wireless communication between your laptop and other nearby NFC devices. And its Dual Band AC (2x2) and Bluetooth® 4.2 make wireless online connectivity a snap.With the option of an integrated touch fingerprint reader, you'll never need to remember your password again! Simply touch the fingerprint scanner to access your L380. It also thwarts biometric hacking with anti-spoofing technology—that means the fingerprint image is saved inside the chip, and as such, it’s not sent out for login authentication when you sign in. Your data is protected too, with the discrete Trusted Platform Module (dTPM), which encrypts your information.",

The L380 will make your employees’ jobs easier, a favor they will return to your IT department. Additional details on these features are available below.The L380 will take on your full workload, thanks to the latest Intel® Core™ processors (with optional Intel® vPro™ technology for advanced security and manageability). Its 2x2 AC WiFi and full array of ports will keep you connected to the internet and a variety of external devices. And inputting commands is a breeze with the optional multitouch display. Get ready to have a much shorter to-do list.The L380 was built for the road warrior, and will go anywhere with ease. Its optional backlit keyboard – with white LEDs – lets you use it in low-light surroundings and complete even the most urgent of tasks despite the late hours, and its optional IPS FHD display is easy on tired, traveling eyes. With up to 12 hours of life in its battery, you’ll get a lot of uninterrupted time without worrying about electrical outlets – and even if you need to plug in, its RapidCharge feature will give you 80% battery capacity in an hour.Whether you need to get online or use a peripheral device, the L380 can connect you. Extensive I/O ports such as USB Type-C, USB 3.0, and HDMI make it easy to plug in most peripheral devices, while Near Field Communication (NFC) technology gives you the luxury of wireless communication between your laptop and other nearby NFC devices. And its Dual Band AC (2x2) and Bluetooth® 4.2 make wireless online connectivity a snap.With the option of an integrated touch fingerprint reader, you'll never need to remember your password again! Simply touch the fingerprint scanner to access your L380. It also thwarts biometric hacking with anti-spoofing technology—that means the fingerprint image is saved inside the chip, and as such, it’s not sent out for login authentication when you sign in. Your data is protected too, with the discrete Trusted Platform Module (dTPM), which encrypts your information.",

    "description": "Simple. Flexible. Compatible. The V330 is easy for IT to deploy, offering the simplicity of Windows 10 Pro, the flexibility of an Ultrabay drive that can house an optical drive or an additional battery, and the hardware compatibility of multiple USB-C and USB 3.0 ports.Reliable. Repairable. Secure. The V330 makes IT maintenance easy, too. It's reliable—as shown by the series of rigorous tests it undergoes against shocks, drops, and other extremes—and secure, thanks to its physical camera shutter, Touch Type fingerprint reader, and integrated TPM 1.2 firmware. And IT can rest easy with the Lenovo Sealed Battery Warranty, offering three-year coverage for non-CRU batteries.Additional details on these features are available below.With the widescreen antiglare IPS display with up to FHD (1920 x 1080) resolution, you'll enjoy rich visuals no matter what you’re doing. Get your work done. Be creative. Watch a movie. The display opens 180 degrees, making it simple to share and collaborate or just get comfortable using your laptop the way you want.The ergonomic keyboard on the V330 was engineered for comfort and typing accuracy. The large touchpad makes it even easier to be productive wherever you are—no mouse required. And with plenty of life in its QuickCharge battery, plus a rechargeable Ultrabay battery for additional battery life, you’ll get a lot of uninterrupted time without worrying about electrical outlets.The V330 exudes professionalism, thanks to its contemporary style, two-color exterior, and thin design with narrow bezels.

We tested it for reliability and durability against eight extreme conditions: shock test; vibration test; keyboard in-system test; hinge life test; fan reliability test; panel scuff test; operating temperature test; and pressure test.This laptop is ready for whatever conditions your business can put it through. And to put your mind further at ease, the V330 is backed by a one- or two-year base warranty, with up to three years total available (see the Services tab for information on Extensions).Whether you're meeting with a prospective new client or your colleagues around the world, the V330 has you covered for a superb video-conferencing experience.

    "description": "Your IT staff will rest easy with the optional infrared camera and touch fingerprint reader, knowing they give the L480 greater security. And it’s been fully redesigned for productivity, meaning IT won’t have to listen to complaints about a slow laptop. The discrete graphics option gives users greater ability to do more without additional strain on the CPU. And its mobility is enhanced by its global LTE-A WWAN, offering more connectivity in remote places, and by the RapidCharge function, allowing users to get up to an 80% charge in just an hour. The L480 will make your employees’ jobs easier, a favor they will return to your IT department. Additional details on these features are available below.The L480 will take on your full workload, thanks to the latest Intel® Core™ processors (with optional Intel® vPro™ technology for advanced security and manageability), optional AMD Radeon™ discrete graphics, a choice of the fast file access of SSD storage or the high capacity of HDD storage, and great memory capacity. Its 2x2 AC WiFi, LTE-A, and full array of ports will keep you connected to the internet and a variety of external devices. And inputting commands is a breeze with optional multitouch display. Get ready to have a much shorter to-do list.The L480 was built for the road warrior. At 13% lighter and 8% thinner than the previous generation, it will go anywhere with ease. Its optional backlit keyboard – with white LEDs – lets you use it in low-light surroundings and complete even the most urgent of tasks despite the late hours. The antiglare IPS FHD display is also easy on the eyes. With up to 12 hours of life in its battery, you’ll get a lot of uninterrupted time without worrying about electrical outlets – and even if you need to plug in, its RapidCharge feature will give you 80% battery capacity in an hour. And when you come back, the new USB-C mechanical side docking makes it easy to reconnect at your desk.Whether you need to get online or use a peripheral device, the L480 can connect you. Extensive I/O ports such as USB Type-C, USB 3.0, and HDMI make it easy to plug in most peripheral devices, while Near Field Communication (NFC) technology gives you the luxury of wireless communication between your laptop and other nearby NFC devices. Dual Band AC (2x2) and Bluetooth® 4.2 make wireless online connectivity a snap, but even if you’re not near a router, integrated global mobile broadband LTE-A will keep you connected.With the option of an integrated touch fingerprint reader and infrared camera, you'll never need to remember your password again! Simply touch the fingerprint scanner to access your L480, or use your face with Windows Hello facial recognition software to log in automatically. What’s more, the fingerprint reader thwarts biometric hacking with anti-spoofing technology—that means the fingerprint image is saved inside the chip, and as such, it’s not sent out for login authentication when you sign in.Your data is protected too, with the discrete Trusted Platform Module (dTPM), which encrypts your information. Lastly, Fast Identity Online (FIDO) enables hardened authentication that wraps your access info in three layers of security. FIDO authentication pertains to your online credentials, when you sign in to websites like Facebook or Google, or make payments via PayPal, Visa, etc. This global solution creates better security for online services, reduces costs for organizations, and is simpler and safer for users.Start with Windows 10 Pro for your L480, which includes your own personal assistant, Cortana. With an 8th Generation Intel® Core™ processor, you'll get powerful performance and speed. Plus, you’ll never have to hunt for files or photos or meetings again – let Cortana do the work for you! Integrate Cortana with your calendar and you can even search by when and with whom you worked on a file, rather than having to remember file names.The L480 was built to last and tested for durability. It packs the renowned ThinkPad reliability and is backed by a one- or two-year base warranty, with up to three years total available (see the Services tab for information on Extensions).",

    "description": "When we completely redesigned the all-new ThinkPad X280, we took portability seriously. It weighs in at 1.1 kg—13% less than its predecessor. And at just 17.4 mm, it’s 15% thinner as well. Which means you’re getting the most compact 12.5” Ultrabook.Despite its aggressively streamlined design, the ThinkPad X280 packs even more punch than previous models. From cutting-edge 8th Gen Intel® Core™ processors to fast PCIe SSD storage, from RapidCharge to its innovative security options, the X280 gives you the resources to drive your business forward.From spilled drinks to drops and knocks, modern laptops need to withstand life on the road. The ThinkPad X280 has you covered. It’s tested against 12 MIL-SPEC requirements and passes more than 200 durability tests. Whether it’s a day at the office, or a day on the move, the X280 has you covered.The ThinkPad X280 delivers starting at 13 hours of battery life. And if you’re running low, the RapidCharge feature provides 80% capacity in just an hour. So a lunch break or a layover is a quick opportunity to bank more than 13 hours on your battery. Connecting on the road—or even in one of your own conference rooms—can be a hassle. That’s why we’ve packed the X280 with a robust selection of connectors—including Thunderbolt, USB Type-C, HDMI, and more.The ThinkPad X280 includes Intel® Thunderbolt™ 3—the technology that brings lightning-fast Thunderbolt to USB-C at speeds up to 40 Gbps. Connect a cable from your USB-C port to a Thunderbolt 3-enabled device, and get four times the data and twice the video bandwidth of any other port type, while also supplying power.Data security is more important than ever. That’s why we designed the X280 with a range of security options. ThinkShutter means you don’t have to put a sticker on your laptop camera to ensure privacy; just close it up when you’re not using it. The match-on-chip touch fingerprint reader gives you secure login without the hassle of passwords. The optional IR Camera also brings the ease of facial login with Windows Hello.",

What’s more, with the 30 Whr battery option, rapid-charge technology helps to boost productivity levels—in just 30 minutes, the device charges 50%. Plus, it runs up to 6 hours on a single charge. This laptop is highly secure with Trusted Platform Module, which works in conjunction with Windows 10 Pro Bitlocker to encrypt data and passwords. And the privacy camera shutter ensures the webcam is off when it’s off—no chance of hackers inconspicuously spying.The full-sized, ergonomic keyboard on the V130 was engineered for comfort and typing accuracy. The large touchpad makes it even easier to be productive wherever you are—no mouse required—and the one-piece design looks sleek. This keyboard is also spill-resistant, so you can go about your business without concern for the little mishaps of daily life.Our V Series laptops undergo reliability and durability checks, to ensure they run smoothly for years to come. From withstanding shocks and vibrations to enduring the rigors of daily handling. From hinge-life testing, to fan reliability, operating temperatures, pressure tests, and more. We know your PC can impact your livelihood, so we make sure your V130 will last. And last With Windows 10 Pro on your V130, you get your very own personal assistant, Cortana. Now, you'll never have to hunt for files, photos, or meetings again—simply let Cortana do the work for you! And when you integrate Cortana with your calendar, you can even search by when and who you worked with on a file, rather than having to remember file names.",
