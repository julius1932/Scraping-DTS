These wireless sleepbuds deliver uniquely engineered sounds that mask unwanted noise and lull you to sleep so that you can wake up refreshed and ready to take on the day. It comes in a combination of storage and charging case which protects and recharges your sleepbuds while not in use. It’s magnetized and so it keeps your earbuds in place while they charge. Soothing Sounds Bose Noise Masking Sleepbuds are designed to help you sleep. Instead of streaming music, they provide you with soothing sounds that cover up unwanted noise and help you to drift into a comfortable slumber. With these earbuds on, you can enjoy the rhythm of rolling waves crashing on a beach, the gentle rustle of leaves and also feel the crackling comfort of a campfire and the evening serenade of crickets. Take your pick from 10 pre-loaded soothing sounds, some optimized for masking and others for relaxation. You can move freely throughout the night with these wireless earbuds since no cords come in your way. The tiny earbud nodule and soft StayHear Plus Sleep tips are designed with side sleepers and toss-and-turners in mind. They fit comfortably in your ear for a good night’s rest. Made with Precision Instead of streaming music, Bose Noise Masking Sleepbuds deliver soothing sounds that mask unwanted night-time noises. No two ears are alike. So, to fit most ear sizes and shapes, and to accommodate side sleepers, scores of three-dimensional scans of ear geometry were taken and used to create a tiny earbud nodule that’s barely larger than a pea. The sleepbuds come in three sizes of StayHear Plus Sleep tips and are designed with a pliable fin that conforms to the upper ridge of your ear. You can move in bed any way you’d want to and yet the earbuds would stay in place. These sleepbuds will fit comfortably and snugly in your ear all night long."
