The text is so sharp and clear you’ll feel like you’re reading documents, email and websites on a printed page. And with 48 per cent more colours than the previous generation, everything you see is rich and vibrant. The display glass goes to the edge of the enclosure, making the borders 50 per cent thinner than before. So you can focus on what’s on your screen and you’re going to love what you see. A New Brand Of Security The advanced security and convenience of Touch ID are now built into the Apple MacBook Air. Simply place your finger on the Touch ID sensor and just like that your Mac unlocks. You can also use your fingerprint to immediately access locked documents, notes and system settings, without entering yet another password. MacBook Air features the Apple T2 Security Chip second generation custom Mac silicon designed by Apple to make MacBook Air even more secure. So when you use Touch ID to unlock your Mac or authenticate a document, your information stays safe. With on-the-fly data encryption, all your data stored on the SSD is automatically and fully encrypted and thanks to the Apple T2 Security Chip, a familiar voice comes to MacBook Air thus Siri is always ready to help open apps, find documents, play music and answer your questions. An All New Keyboard with An All New Trackpad The latest-generation MacBook Air keyboard features our butterfly mechanism providing four times more key stability than a traditional scissor mechanical system. And individual LED-backlit keys with an ambient light sensor help you type in low-light environments. The Force Touch trackpad lets you interact with your Mac in a variety of ways based on subtle differences in pressure. You have precise control and a uniform response no matter where you click the trackpad as well as plenty of room for Multi-Touch gestures like pinch and zoom. Even though it weighs just 1.25 kilograms, the new MacBook Air packs quite a punch. An Intel Core i5 processor with dual-core and 1.6 GHz helps you power through daily activities, from reading email and browsing the web to creating Keynote presentations and editing in iMovie. With the 8 GB of memory lets you work seamlessly even with multiple apps open, while 128 GB of SSD storage lets you launch apps in a flash and provides plenty of room for all your documents, photos and videos. Battery, Speakers & Operating System With the latest in processing and tuning techniques, the Apple MacBook Air sounds better than ever. Stereo speakers deliver twice the bass and 25 per cent more volume than the previous generation. And wider stereo sound creates immersive audio when you’re listening to music or watching a movie. The high-definition FaceTime camera lets you see one or many of your friends and family see you in sharp detail. And three microphones form an array that more accurately captures your voice for FaceTime calls, dictation and talking to Siri, macOS is the operating system that powers everything you do on a Mac. It lets you do things you simply can’t with other computers. That’s because it’s designed specifically for the hardware it runs on and vice versa. Your Mac works with your iphone as well."

    "description": "Description for Apple MacBook Air MRE92 Core i5 8th Gen macOS Laptop (8 GB, 256 GB SSD, 33.02 cm, Space Grey) The most loved Mac is about to make you fall in love all over again with the new thinner and lighter Apple MacBook Air features a brilliant Retina display, Touch ID, the latest-generation keyboard and a Force Touch trackpad. The iconic wedge is created from 100 per cent recycled aluminium, making it the greenest Mac ever. And with all-day battery life, MacBook Air is your perfectly portable, do-it-all notebook. With four times as many pixels as an HD display, the results are positively jaw-dropping. Images take on a new level of detail and realism. The text is so sharp and clear you’ll feel like you’re reading documents, email and websites on a printed page. And with 48 per cent more colours than the previous generation, everything you see is rich and vibrant. The display glass goes to the edge of the enclosure, making the borders 50 per cent thinner than before. So you can focus on what’s on your screen and you’re going to love what you see. A New Brand Of Security The advanced security and convenience of Touch ID are now built into the Apple MacBook Air. Simply place your finger on the Touch ID sensor and just like that your Mac unlocks. You can also use your fingerprint to immediately access locked documents, notes and system settings, without entering yet another password. MacBook Air features the Apple T2 Security Chip second generation custom Mac silicon designed by Apple to make MacBook Air even more secure. So when you use Touch ID to unlock your Mac or authenticate a document, your information stays safe. With on-the-fly data encryption, all your data stored on the SSD is automatically and fully encrypted and thanks to the Apple T2 Security Chip, a familiar voice comes to MacBook Air thus Siri is always ready to help open apps, find documents, play music and answer your questions. Built in Features & Build Quality The latest-generation MacBook Air keyboard features our butterfly mechanism providing four times more key stability than a traditional scissor mechanical system. And individual LED-backlit keys with an ambient light sensor help you type in low-light environments. The Force Touch trackpad lets you interact with your Mac in a variety of ways based on subtle differences in pressure. You have precise control and a uniform response no matter where you click the trackpad as well as plenty of room for Multi-Touch gestures like pinch and zoom. Even though it weighs just 1.25 kilograms, the new MacBook Air packs quite a punch. An Intel Core i5 processor with dual-core and 1.6 GHz helps you power through daily activities, from reading email and browsing the web to creating Keynote presentations and editing in iMovie. With the 8 GB of memory lets you work seamlessly even with multiple apps open, while 256 GB of SSD storage lets you launch apps in a flash and provides plenty of room for all your documents, photos and videos. A Machine for The Pro With the latest in processing and tuning techniques, the Apple MacBook Air sounds better than ever. Stereo speakers deliver twice the bass and 25 per cent more volume than the previous generation. And wider stereo sound creates immersive audio when you’re listening to music or watching a movie. The high-definition FaceTime camera lets you see one or many of your friends and family see you in sharp detail. And three microphones form an array that more accurately captures your voice for FaceTime calls, dictation and talking to Siri, macOS is the operating system that powers everything you do on a Mac. It lets you do things you simply can’t with other computers. That’s because it’s designed specifically for the hardware it runs on and vice versa. Your Mac works with your iphone as well."
