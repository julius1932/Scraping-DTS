    "description": "Description for Belkin Mixit DuraTek Kevlar F8J207bt04 Lightning to USB Cable (Black) The Belkit Mixit DuraTek Lightning to USB Cable is made of Kevlar, a high strength synthetic fibre used as a reinforcing agent to strengthen the conductors and enhance protection. It has insulated conductors which reduce friction while creating added flexibility and protection. The shield-braid and metalized Mylar shielding helps to protect the cable from external electro-magnetic interference. Thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) cable jacket is soft, pliable, and environmentally friendly. Double-braided nylon exterior is abrasion resistant, reducing fraying and lasting longer. Abrasion Resistant One of the key ingredients of Belkit Mixit DuraTek Lightning to USB Cable’s secret strength is Kevlar. This resistant aramid fibre is used the world over for everything from bullet resistant vests and crash helmets to surfboards and extreme sports gear. Strong Kevlar strands are built into the cable adding ultimate strength. Able to flex without stretching, these fibers provide structure to keep the wires inside from damage. The external cable braiding is made from a premium and hard-wearing nylon material. Double braiding is a technique used in rope making and gives maximum strength and added resilience. This makes the cable abrasion resistant, more flexible, lightweight and less prone to fraying. Convenient To Use Inside the cable, many wires co-exist to provide better functionality and conductivity. Insulation protects the wires from damage as the cable bends and flexes, but some can cause stiffness, affecting the overall suppleness of the cable. The highly flexible insulation within the Belkit Mixit DuraTek Lightning to USB Cable minimizes friction, allowing the cable to bend easily and the wires within to move without damage. The 18mm strain relief where the cable joins the connector head has been optimized to withstand the greatest amount of bend cycles. Made from flexible TPE, this added length and flexibility helps to absorb stress and reinforce the juncture between the cable and the connector head to prevent separation. Proven in testing to withstand 5000+ cycles where the cable is bent to 180-degrees, this cable is highly resistant to splitting and breakage. Not just flexible, TPE is also smooth, tactile and more environmentally-friendly than the standard PVC."
