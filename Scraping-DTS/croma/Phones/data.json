An All New Display An innovative backlight design on the allows the Apple iPhone XR screen to stretch into the corners for you to see true-to-life colour from one beautiful edge to the other. Advanced colour management automatically displays your content in wide colour so everything you look at looks amazing. A six-channel light sensor subtly adjusts the white balance onscreen to match the colour temperature of the light around you. Thus images on the display look as natural as on a printed page and are easier on your eyes. The most durable front glass which is sealed and precision-fitted with the aerospace‑grade aluminium band helps create an enclosure that’s water resistant up to 1 metre for 30 minutes. The iPhone XR even resists spills from coffee, tea, soft drinks and more. High Performance Processor The Apple iPhone XR grants you an experience like never before.

So you can now play games, hear music and chat you’re your best friends all at the same time and keep up with the pace of everything around you. Two performance cores tackle heavy computational tasks and four efficiency cores take on everyday tasks. The newest performance controller dynamically divides work across these cores, harnessing all six when a power boost is needed. A new fourth core and lossless memory compression bring big gains in graphics performance to games, video editing and visually demanding apps.
